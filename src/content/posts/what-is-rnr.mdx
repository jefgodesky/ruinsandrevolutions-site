The short version is: _Ruins &amp; Revolutions_ is an ultra-light
tabletop roleplaying game that aims to provide game masters with a set of
tools for maximum versatility with an absolute minimum on mechanical
complexity. It’s intended to be a drop-in replacement for most roleplaying
game systems that you can use as early as your very next game session, to
play in your favorite setting with your favorite characters, with a simple,
open source ruleset that will put the emphasis squarely where you feel it
should go. In that sense, it’s a toolbox for filling in your best game ever.
In this toolbox, there’s really just two tools: _random tables_ and
_scrolls_. But there’s a _lot_ you can accomplish with just these two
tools — more, I’d argue, than you can accomplish with hundreds of pages of
rules that might run you $179.97 or more.

The long answer is, well, rather longer.

## What is a roleplaying game?

It’s been twelve years since [Mike Sugarbaker](https://www.gibberish.com/)
gave the world his take on [what defines a roleplaying game](https://www.gibberish.com/2012/01/14/what-is-a-role-playing-game),
and I am sorry to say that, in all that time, his idea has yet to achieve
the prominence it deserves. With the clarification of “tabletop roleplaying games”
we have, arguably, taken another step away (since the digital heirs of
tabletop play have so far surpassed their analog progenitors in popularity
that _they_ now bear the unqualified name, and it’s the _original_ version
that must now receive modification).

Games are, of course, interactive systems. The rules constrain what moves you
can make, and the state of the game makes some moves good and others bad, to
varying degrees. You make a move, which changes the game state. The game state
sets the context for what move you make, and the move that you make alters the
game state, until we reach some final state. Every game has its own, unique
gameplay loop, but this is the defining shape: what I’ll be calling “the
black loop,” in reference to Sugarbaker’s illustration.

You _can_ make up a story in these games — _anything_ can become a
“roleplaying game” in this sense if you want it to be — but the critical
thing is that these stories don’t affect the game. We can tell a story about
the events leading up to this battle we’re playing out on the chess board
and give every pawn a name, but none of that is going to affect how the
game is played.

According to Sugarbaker, this all changed in 1974 — though perhaps we can push
that back to [1967](https://youtu.be/P-zzrWAQcWQ?si=bKIv_85gEKHGWRtk) — when
the first roleplaying games provided a means by which the stories you make up
could affect game state. This added a new, narrative loop to the gameplay
loop: what I’ll be calling “the green loop,” once again in reference to
Sugarbaker’s illustration.

Of course, once you’ve added a new loop like this, there’s nothing
_requiring_ it to remain secondary to the original. It can become the
_primary_ game loop, with the original gameplay loop of moves and game
states becoming less prominent.

Twelve years ago, when Sugarbaker wrote this article, there was some debate
in some circles of the internet (circles where I spent some time lurking and
even occasionally posting) over the terms “story game“ and “roleplaying game.”
Sugarbaker defines “story game” more broadly as any game that features this
green loop, and is happy to leave “roleplaying game” to be more narrowly
defined as “a story game that hews to the traditions of gameplay that
started in American skirmish wargaming and were crystallized by Arneson
and Gygax.”

## Fiction-First Gaming

The first place I saw the term “fiction-first gaming” was in
_[Blades in the Dark](https://evilhat.com/product/blades-in-the-dark/)_.
It might well have been in circulation somewhere else before that, or it
might be [John Harper’s](http://www.onesevendesign.com/) own invention; I
really have no idea.

The idea of fiction-first gaming is that the _story_ determines which rules
or mechanics are engaged, and when. _Blades_ describes “fiction-first gaming”
as:

> When it’s your turn, you say what your  character does within the ongoing
> fictional narrative. You don’t pick a mechanic first, you say something
> about the fiction first. Your choices in a roleplaying game aren’t
> immediately constrained by the mechanics, they’re constrained by
> the established fictional situation. In other words, the mechanics are
> brought in after the fictional action has determined _which_ mechanics
> we need to use.

Or, to put it in terms of Sugarbaker’s theory, “fiction-first gaming” is when
the green circle drives the black one, rather than the other way around.

This leads us to what I consider the big design innovation in
_Ruins & Revolutions_, one that can be a bit subtle and easy to miss, and
might require 1,000 words of background before we can really say what it
means: in _Ruins & Revolutions_, we push as much of the game state as
possible out of mechanical artifacts (e.g., character sheets or battle
maps) and into the _fiction_, that “shared imagination space” of the world
and its characters.

That might still sound aggravatingly abstract, so let’s bring it down to
earth with an example.

## The Warrior’s Pilgrimage

Miri is a human fighter. She’s setting out to become the greatest human
fighter that she can be.

In _Dungeons & Dragons_ fifth edition, this is a matter of leveling up.
Most groups use milestone leveling, so this means going on adventures
until the dungeon master decides that the party has accomplished enough
to gain a level. At that point, Miri takes the next level in fighter,
granting her all of the abilities that she unlocks at that level from her
class and subclass. Her goal is to reach level 20, so she can unlock all
of the abilities she can, finally achieving her dream of becoming the
greatest human fighter that she can be.

If she’s playing in a group that uses experience points instead, then her
goal is to accumulate 355,000 XP, at which point she’ll reach level 20. However
levels are awarded, though, Miri’s quest to become the greatest human fighter
that she can be is measured mechanically. She records levels, classes,
subclasses, and (maybe) experience points.

In _Ruins & Revolutions_, Miri will have to determine what “the greatest
human fighter she can be” really _means_ to her. Perhaps it means defeating
the deadliest foes. She starts by writing a list of deadly foes that she
wants to defeat: a red dragon, a storm giant, a kraken. Each time she
defeats one, she can cross it off her list. When she learns of some new,
deadly foe, she might add it to the list. This isn’t just a list that the
player has, though; this is a list that _Miri_, the character, has.

Perhaps instead (or in addition), Miri defines “the greatest human fighter she
can be” as mastering a great variety of weapons. She starts with the
longsword. The game master tells her that the basics of the longsword
start with the four basics guards: the ox, the plow, the roof, and the
fool. To master each one, Miri will have to complete three scrolls. So,
for the ox, she needs to complete _Learn the ox_ [4] (which she unseals each
time she is trained by a teacher), _Practice the ox_ [4] (which she unseals
each time she practices the guard), and _Use the ox_ [4] (which she unseals
each time she uses the ox in combat, though she might suffer disadvantage
by doing so, since she hasn’t mastered it yet). When she has completed all
three, she will have mastered the ox, and when she has mastered all four
guards, she will be proficient with the longsword — at which point she can
begin the process of becoming a true master of it. And when she’s finished
_that_, she can move on to the _next_ weapon.

While Miri’s player might need to keep a list of the weapons she’s learning
and where she currently stands with each one, the game state isn’t an
abstraction — it’s the state of Miri’s ongoing education. To become the
greatest human fighter she can be, she has to focus on what it means to
be a great fighter.

This is about concrete details in your setting, not just advancing
through an abstract class but what it actually _means_ to be a great fighter,
specifically. It’s about fleshing out the parts of the world that the
player characters are invested in and want to explore and making that rich
and nuanced and real.

The best part of any roleplaying game is the world and its characters.
_Ruins & Revolutions_ is about shifting the focus from complex rules to
the thing that makes your game fun and engaging: the world and its
characters.

## Storytelling or Roleplaying?

In some corners, saying that roleplaying games have anything to do with
storytelling is a controversial claim, but I find that this often comes
down to what we mean by “story.” To those who decry “storytelling“ in
roleplaying games, “story” means a narrative that exists in a storyteller’s
mind before it is told. The storyteller knows the story in full before she
begins. She’s able to tell the story only _because_ she already knows it.
As such, this is antithetical to any idea of a _game_. A story is, by
definition, known beforehand, while a game whose outcome is known beforehand
is scarcely worth playing.

As a fan of Walter Ong’s _[Orality and Literacy](https://www.routledge.com/Orality-and-Literacy-30th-Anniversary-Edition/Ong/p/book/9780415538381)_,
I hear some very _literate_ assumptions at work in this argument. Writing
advice insists that a story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but
this is an artifact of the medium of _writing_. _Writing_, thanks to its
“thing-like” qualities, must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, because
books are objects and objects are finite. The earliest written works, like the
_Iliad_, the _Odyssey_, or _Beowulf_, are transcriptions of oral tradition.
What feel like rambling tangents to modern readers are, in fact, examples of
oral storytelling, where every story connected to every other story, all linked
together in one conversation stretching back to the very first utterances ever
made by chattering apes. The tangents that abruptly end, the side characters
and events that are mentioned but never elaborated upon, are the scars where
the author had to cut this endless web to fit the story into a single, written
work.

The “stories” in “story games” are more akin to oral stories than literate
ones, and story games more akin to oral tradition than literature. There
is no singular “storyteller,” and if the game devolves into one person
telling a story, something has gone seriously wrong. The master of
ceremonies in _[Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com/)_ has only
three items on her agenda, and one of them is to “Play to find out what
happens.” The story isn’t something that anyone knows ahead of time; it’s
the thing that we discover together, _by playing_. The critics are correct
that these stories might not be of great literary quality, but the key here
is that they’re not of great _literary_ quality. They are often fine
examples of _orality_, though.

I’ve really never seen this point made more beautifully than it was by
Avery Alder in _[Monsterhearts](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts)_,
where she explains her game’s version of that same agenda item, phrased so
evocatively as “Keep the story feral.” She describes the impulse to take
control of the story as “domesticating” it, and then she writes:

> The game loses its magic when any one player attempts
> to take control of the story. It becomes small enough to
> fit inside one person’s head. The other players turn into
> audience members instead of participants.

A lot of my favorite games are built less around genres than around
particular story arcs. You have total freedom to play out the particulars,
but the rules of the game compel a particular shape. Every game of
_[Polaris](https://www.tao-games.com/polaris/)_ is unique, but every game
is a tragedy. Every game of
_[Misspent Youth](https://www.fraggingunicorns.com/misspent-youth)_
has moments of hope and victory side-by-side with moments of
self-destruction and poor impulse control.

_Ruins & Revolutions_ isn’t that, though. It’s more of a toolbox that makes
it easy for you as a game master to create your _own_ experiences like that. It
makes it easy to make particular themes and ideas real and tangible, and
then play to find out what happens.

## Ruins, Revolutions & You

If you have a regular game that you’ve been enjoying, with a world and
characters that you want to keep exploring, but you’re feeling like the
system you’re using right now is holding you back, or is too heavy and
complex, or too slow, or just, I don’t know, is created and owned by a
corporation you kind of despise and want nothing more to do with (so
random, I know), _Ruins & Revolutions_ is a game that you should
consider. You should be able to replace your current ruleset with it for
your very next session. Yes, many players are resistant to the idea of
learning a new ruleset, but _Ruins & Revolutions_ fits on the front and back
of a single sheet of paper. You can teach all of the player-facing rules
in under a minute. The harder part is on you as the game master, but even
there the hardest part is thinking about your setting in greater detail
than you might have before — the sort of thing that will benefit your game
no matter what rules you use.

If you want more emphasis on your world and its characters, then
_Ruins & Revolutions_ is a game that you should consider. The best part of
all the best games I’ve ever played were the worlds and their characters, not
the rules. _Ruins & Revolutions_ leans into that, making your world and its
characters the rules as much as it can, not with an endless toolbox of
optional rules, but with two really solid, simple tools that you can apply to
your taste to model any situation.

If you want a game where social interactions, relationships, factions,
artistic endeavors, diplomatic negotiations, philosophical ponderings, and
even societal change are as mechanically engaging as combat is in other
games, _Ruins & Revolutions_ is a game that you should consider.

## What you can expect from this blog

The main purpose of this blog will be to explore the ways that you can
use _Ruins & Revolutions_ to bring your ideas to the table. When to use a
particular table, or start a scroll, is a creative decision that the game
master makes, an act of artistic expression that puts another stitch in the
unfolding tapestry of your game. These are the threads you’ll use to weave
the world. This blog will be all about some of the embroidery techniques you
can consider to do that more effectively.

Even if you’re not playing _Ruins & Revolutions_, though, you might still
find some useful things here. After all, the tools that _Ruins & Revolutions_
offers are simple and ubiquitous. Most games have dice rolls and random
tables. While scrolls are a little less common, they’re an idea that you can
easily bolt on to most other systems.

I designed _Ruins & Revolutions_ with the principle in mind that a few simple
rules can lead to very complex outcomes. I’ve already spent many more words
_describing_ the game than its rules actually contain, so we’ll leave it here
for now. We’ll have all of this blog’s future posts to explore all the roads
this can open for us.
