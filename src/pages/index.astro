	<p><em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> is a simple framework for
	  tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) that puts the emphasis on
		your world, your characters, and your&nbsp;story.</p>

			<h3>Adaptable Rules</h3>
			<p>The basic rules fit on the front and back of a single sheet
			  of paper, but it creates space to add as much (or as little)
			  complexity as your game calls&nbsp;for.</p>

			<h3>Focus on Your&nbsp;World</h3>
			<p><em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> can be a no-prep alternative
			  for your existing game ready to play tonight. If you enjoy prep,
			  spend it on your world instead of the&nbsp;rules.</p>
