		<p><em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> is a simple framework for
			tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) that puts the emphasis on
			your world, your characters, and your&nbsp;story.</p>

		<div class="features">
			<section>
				<h3>Adaptable Rules</h3>
				<p>The basic rules fit on the front and back of a single sheet
					of paper, but it creates space to add as much (or as little)
					complexity as your game calls&nbsp;for.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Focus on Your&nbsp;World</h3>
				<p><em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> can be a no-prep alternative
					for your existing game ready to play tonight. If you enjoy prep,
					spend it on your world instead of the&nbsp;rules.</p>

		<p><em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> works on the interaction between
			three basic but powerful&nbsp;concepts:</p>
		<div class="features">
			<section>
				<h3>Scales</h3>
				<p>Scales allow you to pace development, whether it&rsquo;s
					one character&rsquo;s attitude towards another, the
					journey to master a tool or technique, or the effort to
					fundamentally change a whole&nbsp;society.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Scrolls</h3>
				<p>Scrolls give the game master a way to pace developing
					threats, issues, and concerns &mdash; and a way for players
					to understand how their actions can either stop those
					things from happening, or help them&nbsp;along.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Random Tables</h3>
				<p>Every roll is on a random table. The basic table builds
					in tension from degrees of success and failure, but more
					specific random tables can make the important moments in
					your game&nbsp;shine.</p>
			</section>

		<section class="blog">
			<h3>Recent Blog Posts</h3>
			{recentPosts.map(post => (
				<BlogCard
					url={`/blog/${post.slug}`}
					frontmatter={post.data}
				/>
